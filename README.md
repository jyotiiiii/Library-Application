# Library-Application

The new LibraryApp folder contains all the files and folders as they are currently saved on my machine (Rosa). Cheryl and I tried it all via hangout and everything seemed to be working. 

I tried to create a global catalogue but this is not possible with Items being an abstract class. Instead, I have created methods to get all dvds and all books which can be called alongside each other. 

Improvements that could be done:
Look through constructors and identify where regex and set values would make sense - e.g. format for dvd releasedate, list of valid languages, etc.

Review needed: 
Download and try on your machines to see it works
Not sure whether namespaces and folder structure are the right way - we've had a long conversation about it

Further development work we will be looking into (time allowing):
Login functionality - Cheryl
Loans class - Rosa
